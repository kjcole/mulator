Elements of this project are built on ideas garnered from this
[AppInventor 4-Bit Computer
Simulator](http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/webapps/computer/gen0.html)
produced by the [Computer Science
Department](http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/Computer/Pages/default.aspx)
at [Trinity College](http://www.trincoll.edu/), Hartford,
Connecticut.

Although I am not (yet) using it,  Chris Meyer's [Simulator for a Mytical
Machine](http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/mm/simulator.html) may end
up having an influence on this code.
