This is an early, early, attempt to emulate a simple 8-bit processor
using pseudo-op codes. It is being designed as a tool to teach high
school students the basics of binary and machine language. Due to
screen real estate considerations, and the fact that too many ones
and zeros make the eyes glaze over, it may evolve into a hexadecimal
machine display eventually.
