  The machine emulator as I would do it.

  Note that the following are useful binary conversions in Python.

      x = "1111"
      y = int(x, base=2)        # Converts binary string to integer value
      print(y)                  # Prints integer as a decimal value
      print("{0:b}".format(y))  # Prints integer as a binary value
      z = 0b1111                # Assign an integer as a binary value
      print(z)                  # Print integer as a decimal value
